# Social Stockfish Project Brief

## Project Overview
Social Stockfish is an AI-powered conversation simulation system that helps users optimize their conversations by looking ahead multiple moves and selecting the most effective responses. The system draws inspiration from chess engines, particularly Stockfish, applying similar principles to conversation optimization.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Conversation Tree Generation
- Implement two LLM models (User Proxy and Opponent Proxy)
- Generate multiple possible responses for each conversation turn
- Build conversation trees with configurable depth (default 5 moves ahead)
- Support probability weighting for responses
- Visualize conversation paths in real-time

### 2. Conversation Evaluation
- Implement scoring system for conversation paths
- Evaluate paths based on goal achievement
- Support multiple evaluation criteria
- Maintain probability tracking for paths
- Display evaluation results in intuitive UI

### 3. Monte Carlo Simulation
- Implement probability-weighted sampling of paths
- Support parallel processing of simulations
- Optimize for real-time performance
- Implement pruning strategies for efficiency
- Visualize simulation progress and results

### 4. API Management
- Handle rate limiting through rotation of API credentials
- Implement parallel API calls
- Optimize cost efficiency
- Support multiple LLM providers
- Manage WebSocket connections for real-time updates

### 5. Performance Requirements
- Response time: < 5 seconds for next move suggestion
- Support for multiple conversation contexts
- Efficient memory usage
- Scalable architecture
- Real-time UI updates

### 6. User Interface
- Modern, clean chat interface
- Real-time conversation visualization
- Goal setting and management
- Analysis results display
- Alternative response suggestions
- Connection status indicators
- Video call capabilities
- Version information display

### 7. Visualization Requirements
- Conversation state exploration matrix
- Monte Carlo evaluation visualization
- Path probability indicators
- Tree-based conversation visualization
- Real-time updates and animations
- Interactive elements for exploration

## Success Criteria
1. Successfully generate and evaluate conversation trees
2. Provide actionable next-move suggestions
3. Maintain reasonable API costs through optimization
4. Achieve near real-time performance
5. Support multiple conversation goals and contexts
6. Deliver intuitive and responsive user interface
7. Provide clear visualization of system operation
8. Enable effective conversation optimization
